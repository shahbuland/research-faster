# research-faster
This project is a personal tool for speeding up research process. The main goal is to be able to read/digest papers faster and understand research code (aka messy badly organized code) faster from github. At the moment it is essentially just a paper PDF processor for ChatGPT.

# Setup  
Requires Marker and a sufficient GPU to run it. It has a bit of a lengthy install process but once you have it, it can process PDF files very quickly: [Marker](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker/tree/master)  

# TODO
- [ ] Add Claude Opus (probably better than ChatGPT for science)
- [ ] Github repository parsing
